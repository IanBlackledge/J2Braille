A Java library that translates English strings into Braille.

Currently only supports very minimal Grade 1 translation. I plan to support Grade 2 in the future, once Grade 1 is completed.

I'm using the [Branah.com](https://www.branah.com/braille-translator) translator to verify accuracy; I can't read Braille myself.
